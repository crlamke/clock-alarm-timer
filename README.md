# Project Under Development - Only a few parts are functional
## clock-alarm-timer
HTML, CSS, JS based clock with alarm and timer

This clock with a timer and (eventually) multiple alarms is based on the demo at https://tutorialzine.com/2013/06/digital-clock-adding-alarms, with a custom liberal license -https://tutorialzine.com/license.

This project is just getting started and I'm working it only on weekends when I have free time so expect slow progress. The timer works but you can't set a specific alarm time yet.

The action buttons are icons from Google's material.io site - https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline, with an Apache 2.0 license.
